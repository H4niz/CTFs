[What is CTF?](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)

#### List of CTFs:

 * [2016](https://github.com/TraiOi/CTF_WriteUp/blob/master/2016/README.md)

 * [2017](https://github.com/TraiOi/CTF_WriteUp/blob/master/2017/README.md)

#### List of tools (I use):

###### Reverse Engineering
 
 * [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2): (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities that can be used together or independently from the command line.

 * [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/): is a Windows, Linux or Mac OS X hosted multi-processor disassembler and debugger that offers so many features it is hard to describe them all. Just grab an evaluation version if you want a test drive.

###### Explotation

 * [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/): is the most popular debugger for UNIX systems to debug C and C++ programs.

 * [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda): Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB.

 * [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools): is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

###### Forensics

 * [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development.

###### Cryptography

  * [John The Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/): John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows, DOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are Windows LM hashes, plus lots of other hashes and ciphers in the community-enhanced version.

###### Web Explotation

 * [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/): command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
