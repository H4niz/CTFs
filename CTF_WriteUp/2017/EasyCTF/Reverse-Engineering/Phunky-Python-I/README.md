## Phunky Python I

> The other day we happened upon a dusty old laptop covered in duct tape and surrounded by several papers with notes scrawled all over them. Upon inspection, we found that the laptop contained several python files labeled `phunky`.
> 
> We've determined that each of the files contains a mini reversing challenge. The first task is simple: Find the value of `x` such that the program prints out `easyctf` (make sure it's lowercase!).
