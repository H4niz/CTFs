## Not Star Trek

> You've been hired as a Forensics expert. A special police force caught a rebel planning to destroy a military installation. I think this is related to some 'plans' we found transmitted earlier. They found a flashdrive on him, but didn't find anything useful. We took a DD image of the flash drive and are sending it to you. You're trying to find any information on their attack plans or organization. Good Luck.
