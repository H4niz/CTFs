## Shane and the binary files

> Shane is a part of one of the teams in the FBI, which is currently handling a very weird cyber crime case. As a part of the investigation, Shane was asked to analyze a series of binary files, one of which is known to give out a password. Shane got the files in a zip file named "parallel.zip". Could you help him do it ?
